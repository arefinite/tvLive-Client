As well as its pioneering LED TV range, Cello also focuses much of its efforts on providing the best after sales service in the industry. Cello’s goal is not only to provide an efficient and professional after sales facility, but also to offer superior technical support. Both of these services are highly advanced in comparison to the after sales offered by our competitors.

Advantages of UK manufacturing
TvLive products are manufactured on a specially developed production line based in the UK. Located in the North East of England, TvLive TVs are assembled to exact specifications in order to ensure that every single Cello TV is produced to the highest standard.

The UK based assembly line holds many benefits for its clients. Trade customers can see stock being produced and are also able to be involved in the product quality checks. Custom changes to specific Cello TVs can also be made during the production process and clients can see the meticulous quality procedures that all products go through.
